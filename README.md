## **WARNING:** This repo is no longer maintained!
This fork's no longer going to have updates. It was decided for few reasons:

- (Main reason): Recent updates in the upstream codebase made it really hard to conveniently synchronize this repo with upstream,
- neofetch is included in the upstream anyway, it's simply not embedded into the `SHELL.PRG` binary and it doesn't appear on the start-up.

That being said, please head to [upstream cx16shell repo](https://github.com/irmen/cx16shell) if you want to have the newest features and bugfixes, **this repo is an Archive.**

# Shell for Commander X16 with neofetch

A soft-fork of [cx16shell](https://github.com/irmen/cx16shell) that has the neofetch embedded into the Shell binary, and runs that embedded neofetch when starting.
