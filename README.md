## Compiling the shell

You'll need a very recent prog8 compiler to build this from source.
If the latest official release gives you problems compiling this program, you may have to use
the git master version that hasn't been officially released yet.

Just type ``make`` to compile the shell
Type ``make emu`` to compile and immediately start it in the Commander X16 emulator.

Save SHELL.PRG as AUTOBOOT.X16 to the sd-card to automatically load and run the shell at startup.


## Usage

Type "help" or "?" at the prompt to get a list of the built-in commands.

"basic" will get you back to a normal Basic prompt.
